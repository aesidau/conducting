# Conducting
Choregraphe project for a Nao robot to conduct an orchestra.

Download the Choregraphe IDE from https://community.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en/resources/software/language/en-gb

Choregraphe v2.1.4.13 was used to create this project, and run on a Nao robot V5.

Note that Choregraph does not tolerate a .git directory. It must be moved temporarily outside of the project directory.
