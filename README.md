# Conducting
Choregraphe project for a Nao robot to conduct an orchestra.

Download the Choregraphe IDE from https://community.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en/resources/software/language/en-gb

Choregraphe v2.1.4.13 was used to create this project, and run on a Nao robot V5.

Tapping the middle head sensor (the one in the circle) will start the routine. Tapping one of the other head sensors (at the front or back) will cause the conducting to stop early. Otherwise, it will conduct 17 bars of 3/4.

Note that Choregraph does not tolerate a .git directory. It must be moved temporarily outside of the project directory.
